AS part as the migration to a microservices architecture we need to gather information from the current C# monolith application.
With all the information of the C# app we can identify which services are running now and plan a nodejs conversion.
Getting the services we can a start a paralell development of each service in nodejs.
In addition each new microservice will have their own database so we can reduce the DB instance with multiple smaller databases.
The new microservice model will can be implemented using Docker containers. Moving each microservice to production environment
we can deploy a new C# app version who will consume the new microservice and will have disabled the old code part in C#.
